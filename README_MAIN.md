# MAIN branch for Anddd7

Since the upstream repo is inactive, this fork will use <main> as the active branch. 

- master: keep the same as upstream
- main: my active branch

## How to maintain

- checkout from main branch, add feat/fix/..., create PR and merge to main
- if it's usable, create PR to upstream/master
